    <h1>Random number generator and Minecraft</h1>
    <p>
        RNG is not really random. It just looks random because the way the numbers are chosen <strong>seem</strong> arcahic but the aren't really
        arcahic. You use a seed to plug into an equation and then that equation spits out many different entries. So RNG isn't really
        random but it has some intresting connotations in video games. For example Minecraft By knowing the seed 
        you have the ability to predict what could happen in a program, for example a minecraft world will spawn diffrent entities 
        in different places, with a seed predictor you can figure out what spawns where if you have the seed. However many consider this cheating.
        If you want to use seed predictors you can use this <a href="https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map" title="one" target="_blank">one</a>.
        Of course many other games employ the use of a seed but some may or may not give you the ability to see what the seed is, or give 
        you the option to enter in a seed of choice.
